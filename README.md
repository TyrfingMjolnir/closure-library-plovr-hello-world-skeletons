Closure Library Skeletons: Plovr Hello World
============================================

This repository contains varius skeletons used for development with Closure Library, Compiler and Plovr. It helps beginners to start.

To put your script in the workbench with Plovr up your sleeve, instructions for Mac OS X below.

cd googlemaps
open main.html
make
( leave the terminal window open, press CTRL + C you are done running your script in the workbench )

Now edit main.js or any other script to your heartâ€™s content,
with your favourite text editor, I tend to use vim. :set omnifunc=javascriptcomplete#CompleteJS

to test it just reload the file main.html that you opened in your browser.
